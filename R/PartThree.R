What else do you need covered in this class? Problem solving skills would be nice. Knowing how to google effeciently to find info on packages or errors.
Is anyone else in your lab doing similar analyses? No, I am the only one in my lab with movement data, but a previous graduate student had a similar project and used ArcGIS and SYSTAT for analyses.
Do you think in the future, there will be other students working on your question in your lab? Not the same question, but there could be a chance someone would do a telemerty project.
